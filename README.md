# Best Friend Wish Project 🎂

A personalized birthday/best friend wish website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Run

This is a **static website**, meaning it runs in the browser, not in a Node.js backend environment.

### Option 1: Open File Directly

Simply double-click `index.html` or drag it into your browser window.

### Option 2: Local Server (Recommended)

If you have Python installed (likely on Linux), run this in the terminal:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Customization

- **Images**: Add your photos to the `assets/` folder and update `index.html`.
- **Message**: Edit the text in the "Letter" section of `index.html`.
